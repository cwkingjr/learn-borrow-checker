# Rust Learning Project

This project is dedicated to learning and understanding the Rust programming language, with a particular focus on its unique features such as ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes.

## Project Structure

The project is structured around a series of lessons, each focusing on a different aspect of Rust. Each lesson is contained within its own `.rs` file in the `src` directory.

## Running the Project

To run the project, you will need to have Rust and Cargo installed on your machine. You can then use the `cargo run` command in the terminal from the project's root directory.
